    <p1 style="background-color:lightblue;">My name is Irwing Vielma currently a Junior attending Cristo Rey New York High School. ScriptEd unfolded me the basics of coding which imply HTML and CSS; I took ScriptEd for two years, my Sophomore and Junior year. ScriptEd exposed me to coding languages I never thought I would continue practicing. Coding wasn't my "profession" having to apply the peculiar language appeared complicated and tedious. Over time, I was able to attain delight in the projects I tackle. Although coding can be tedious; I enjoy operating with the code, giving animations to my projects. Currently interning at Credit Suisse allows me to reach my full potential in multiple languages such as AngularJS, HTML, CSS, and more coding in the process which include .NET framework (C#, and VB.net).</p1>
